# Why should I use this extension?
As I analyzed some of "backup finder" tools, I realized that almost all of the available tools use <b>only</b> static payloads (they use built-in dictionaries) and they don't generate dynamic payloads based on target which is being tested.</br>
</br>For example, suppose this is hierarchy tree of our web application:</br>
</br>/</br>
├───<b>upload</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;#Dir</br>
├───├───index.php</br>
├───├───index.php~</br>
├───├───index.php.bkup</br>
├───├───upload.zip</br>
├───└───<b>users</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;#Dir</br>
├───────├───index.php</br>
├───────├───catalog.zip</br>
├───<b>WeirdDirName</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;#Dir</br>
├───├───index.php</br>
├───├───captcha.php</br>
├───├───captcha.php.old</br>
├───WeirdDirName.tar.gz</br></br>
and this is the result of a crawler:</br>
/</br>
├───<b>upload</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;#Dir</br>
├───├─── /</br>
├───└───<b>users</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;#Dir</br>
├───────├─── /</br>
├───<b>WeirdDirName</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;#Dir</br>
├───├─── /</br>
├───├───captcha.php</br></br>

This extension will find all backup, old and temp files in this scenario:</br>
* /upload/index.php~ (Dynamic, finds possible extension and index file)
* /upload/index.php.bkup (Dynamic, finds possible extension and index file)
* /upload/upload.zip (Dynamic, using current dir name)
* /upload/users/catalog.zip (Static, using dictionary)
* /WeirdDirName.tar.gz (Dynamic, using child dir name)
* /WeirdDirName/captcha.php.old (Dynamic, using current dir name)

# Installation
The quickest way is to load the jar file (BackupFinder.jar) in the extender tab of the Burpsuite.</br>
Extender -> Extensions -> Add</br>
A new tab will be added to the burp suite.</br>


# Quick Start
1. Select a request of a target host from any tab of the burp suite
2. In "backupFinder -> Finder -> options" tab, apply your configurations.
3. Go to "backupFinder -> Finder -> Finder" tab and click on "start" button.

# Fine Tuning (To have the best results)
This extension uses the datas in the target tab (which are collected actively or passively) under the domain name that you call extension for as its feed.
to have the best result, it's recommended that you first do these steps before starting the extension process:
* crawl the domain actively using the Burpsuite crawler. (in the target tab: right click on the domain -> scan -> crawl only)
* If the application needs authentication, login via browser and submit the forms to see if there are more files or directories to be listed under our target.

# Build From Source Code
1. To build the project, you need <a href="https://gradle.org/install/">Gradle</a> installed.</br>
2. Clone the repository</br>`git clone https://github.com/moeinfatehi/Backup-Finder`
3. Open the main directory of the project (where build.gradle file exists) and run: `gradle makeJar`
4. The Jar file will be generated in "build/libs/Backup-finder.jar"

# Some of the options
These options can be used to customize the detection:
* Level: Level of tests to perform (1-5, default 3)
* Thread: num of threads (1-50, default 10)
* Built-in dictionary: there is a built-in dictionary containing the most used directory and file names to be used for static payload generation.
* Loadable dictionary: you can use your dictionary file for static payload generation.
* HTTP method: HTTP method to be used in requests (HEAD, GET)(default: Head)
* Includable extensions
* Excludable extensions
* Includable status codes
* Excludable status codes
